# Predicting Churn in a Subscription Service Using Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Overview

This project aims to predict churn in a subscription service by analyzing the sentiment expressed in customer reviews.  The analysis involves collecting customer reviews, performing sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), and then developing a predictive model to identify subscribers at high risk of churning.  This allows for proactive intervention strategies to improve customer retention.  The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the sentiment analysis to the console, including summary statistics on the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g.,  `sentiment_distribution.png`, `churn_prediction_accuracy.png`) illustrating the results of the analysis and the performance of the predictive model. These plots will be saved in the project's directory.  The specific outputs may vary depending on the data used.
